##JavaScript and jQuery

The initial purpose of this project was to compare plain JavaScript and jQuery in terms of creating a simple UI that implements elementary interactivity. This, along with the fact that I've been fiddling around with the Grunt "uglify" plugin, should explain the existence of multiple JavaScript files.

Since I never got around to finishing the plain JavaScript implementation, this should be considered a jQuery exercise. After switching over to jQuery (to mimic the functionality implemented in plain JS), I decided to build out the remaining idea in jQuery since it's so much more readable and concise.

**Note**: This project, in terms of its content, is a joke. Consider it programming practice, some philosophy, and a little bit of trolling. I do, however, hold the view that determinism is false (that a libertarian free will incompatible with determinism is real).
