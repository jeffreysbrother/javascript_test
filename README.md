##JavaScript and jQuery

The purpose of this project is to compare plain JavaScript and jQuery in terms of creating a simple UI that implements elementary interactivity.

We can easily toggle between JavaScript files by commenting out either jquery.js (along with the link to the jQuery library) or script.js.

**Note**: I have not finished the plain JavaScript implementation. After switching over to jQuery (to mimic the functionality implemented in JS), I decided to build out the remaining idea in jQuery since it's so much more readable and concise.

**Note2**: This project, in terms of its content, is a joke. A bit of programming practice plus some trolling. I do, however, hold the view that determinism is false.
