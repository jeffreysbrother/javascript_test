    <p>So you must believe that practical reasons (considerations having to do with the rational attainment of a future goal) have the ability to compel you to act. But why should we think that perceiving one line of action to be superior to another <em>necessitates</em> the corresponding action? And why not just classify these "reasons" for action as being <em>explanations</em> rather than causal elements?</p>
    <p>If it is suggested that an individual can choose no color besides his favorite color unless he experiences another inclination strong enough to override the original, then it looks like we're left with a mere re-wording of the thesis of determinism. What we need, of course, is <em>justification</em> of this outlook.</p>
    <p>In a few sentences, please attempt to justify the thesis of determinism:</p>

    <p>Please explain yourself below:</p>

    <p>Your answer is correct!!</p>
    <p>That is, unless someone was standing behind you shouting orders, or there was some kind of technological malfunction.</p>
